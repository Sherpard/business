 * SpecificationBuilder is a DSL that makes it easy to create complex composite specifications. It relies on expressing
 * boolean predicates in the disjunctive normal form, which is a disjunction (OR) of conjunctive clauses (AND). In other
 * words it requires that the predicates are expressed as an OR clause of AND clauses.
 *
 * <p>
 * Examples of formulae in DNF:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>(A ∧ ¬B ∧ ¬C) ∨ (¬D ∧ E ∧ F)</li>
 * <li>(A ∧ B) ∨ C</li>
 * <li>A ∧ B</li>
 * <li>A</li>
